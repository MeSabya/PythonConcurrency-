# With

#### The with statement wraps the execution of a block of statements in a context defined by a context manager object.

>Programs often use resources other than CPU time, including access to local disks, network sockets, and databases etc. The usage pattern is usually a try-except-finally block. Any cleanup actions are performed in the finally block. An alternative to the usual boilterplate code is to use the with statement.

## Context Management Protocol
A context manager object abides by the context management protocol, which states that an object defines the following two methods. Python calls these two methods at appropriate times in the resource management cycle:

```doc
__enter__()

__exit__()
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Context managers can be used in scenarios to save and restore global state, lock and unlock resources, close opened files, etc.**

The with statement is used as:
```doc
    with context-expression [as target]:
        statement#1
        statement#2
            .
            .
            .
        statement#n
```
1. ```__enter__()``` should return an object that is assigned to the variable after as in the above template. By default the returned object is None, and is optional. A common pattern is to return self and keep the functionality required within the same class.

2. ```__exit__()``` is called on the original Context Manager object, not the object returned by __enter__(). If, however, we return self in the __enter__() method, then it is obviously the same object.

3. If an error is raised in __init__() or __enter__() then the code block is never executed and __exit__() is not called.

4. Once the code block is entered, __exit__ is always called, even if an exception is raised in the code block.

5. In case an exception is raised when executing the block of code wrapped by the with statement, three values consisting of the exception types, its value and traceback are passed as arguments to the __exit__() method. These parameters are None if no exceptions occur. Lastly, if an exception was raised and the __exit__() method returns True, the exception is suppressed. On the contrary, if __exit__() returns false then the exception is re-raised.

The most common use of the with statement happens when we manipulate files. Without the with statement, file manipulation would look as follows:

```python
    file = None
    try:
        file = open("test.txt")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

    finally:
        if file is not None:
            file.close()
 ```
Using the with statement the above code is simplified as:

```python
with open("test.txt") as file:    
    data = file.read() 
```

## Using With Statement in Multithreading
Some classes in the threading module such as Lock, support the context management protocol and can be used with the with statement.

:point_right: we don't need to explicitly acquire() and release() the lock object. The context manager automatically takes care of managing the lock for us.
