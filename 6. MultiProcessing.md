In order to utilize all the cores, multiprocessing module provides a **Pool** class. The Pool class represents a pool of worker processes. 
It has methods which allows tasks to be offloaded to the worker processes in a few different ways. 

Here, the task is offloaded/distributed among the cores/processes automatically by Pool object. User doesnâ€™t need to worry about creating processes explicitly.

```python
# Python program to understand
# the concept of pool

import multiprocessing
import os

def square(n):
	print("Worker process id for {0}: {1}".format(n, os.getpid()))
	return (n*n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
	# input list
	mylist = [1,2,3,4,5]

	# creating a pool object
	p = multiprocessing.Pool()

	# map list to target function
	result = p.map(square, mylist)

	print(result)
```

Let us try to understand above code step by step:

We create a Pool object using:
```
  p = multiprocessing.Pool()
```

There are a few arguments for gaining more control over offloading of task. These are:

**processes**: specify the number of worker processes.

**maxtasksperchild**: specify the maximum number of task to be assigned per child.

All the processes in a pool can be made to perform some initialization using these arguments:

**initializer**: specify an initialization function for worker processes.

**initargs**: arguments to be passed to initializer.

Now, in order to perform some task, we have to map it to some function. In the example above, we map mylist to square function. As a result, the contents of mylist and definition of square will be distributed among the cores.
  
  result = p.map(square, mylist)
