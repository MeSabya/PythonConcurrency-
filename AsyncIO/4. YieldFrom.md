# Yield From
```python
def nested_generator():
    i = 0
    while i < 5:
        i += 1
        yield i


def outer_generator():
    nested_gen = nested_generator()

    for item in nested_gen:
        yield item

if __name__ == "__main__":

    gen = outer_generator()

    for item in gen:
        print(item)
```

👆 has two generator functions. The outer_generator() calls the nested_generator() in a loop and returns values from the inner generator to the main script.

We can refactor the above code as :
```python
def nested_generator():
    i = 0
    while i < 5:
        i += 1
        yield i

def outer_generator_with_yield_from():
    nested_gen = nested_generator()
    yield from nested_gen


if __name__ == "__main__":
  
    gen_using_yield_from = outer_generator_with_yield_from()

    for item in gen_using_yield_from:
        print(item)
```
>In this example the outer_generator() is called the delegating generator and the nested generator is called the subgenerator.

### Yield from Usages

>yield from g is equivalent to for v in g: yield v

The above statement does not completely do the justice what yield from is capabale of doing, usecases are:

### ✔ Reading data from a generator using yield from
```python
def reader():
    """A generator that fakes a read from a file, socket, etc."""
    for i in range(4):
        yield '<< %s' % i

def reader_wrapper(g):
    # Manually iterate over data produced by reader
    for v in g:
        yield v

wrap = reader_wrapper(reader())
for i in wrap:
    print(i)
```

👉 **Instead of manually iterating over reader(), we can just yield from it.**

def reader_wrapper(g):
    yield from g

### ✔Sending data to coroutine using yield from - Part1

Now let's do something more interesting. Let's create a coroutine called writer that accepts data sent to it and writes to a socket, fd, etc.

```python
def writer():
    """A coroutine that writes data *sent* to it to fd, socket, etc."""
    while True:
        w = (yield)
        print('>> ', w)
```
👉 **Now the question is, how should the wrapper function handle sending data to the writer, so that any data that is sent to the wrapper is transparently sent to the writer()?**
```python
def writer_wrapper(coro):
    # TBD
    pass

w = writer()
wrap = writer_wrapper(w)
wrap.send(None)  # "prime" the coroutine
for i in range(4):
    wrap.send(i)

# Expected result
>>  0
>>  1
>>  2
>>  3
```

The wrapper needs to accept the data that is sent to it (obviously) and should also handle the StopIteration when the for loop is exhausted. Evidently just doing for x in coro: yield x won't do. Here is a version that works.

```python
def writer_wrapper(coro):
    coro.send(None)  # prime the coro
    while True:
        try:
            x = (yield)  # Capture the value that's sent
            coro.send(x)  # and pass it to the writer
        except StopIteration:
            pass
```
👉 Or, we could do this.

```python
def writer_wrapper(coro):
    yield from coro

```
### ✔Sending data to coroutine using yield from - Part 2 - Exception handling

👉 What if our writer needs to handle exceptions ❓ Let's say the writer handles a SpamException and it prints *** if it encounters one.

```python
class SpamException(Exception):
    pass

def writer():
    while True:
        try:
            w = (yield)
        except SpamException:
            print('***')
        else:
            print('>> ', w)
```

What if we don't change writer_wrapper? Does it work? Let's try

###### writer_wrapper same as above: Part1 👆
```python
w = writer()
wrap = writer_wrapper(w)
wrap.send(None)  # "prime" the coroutine
for i in [0, 1, 2, 'spam', 4]:
    if i == 'spam':
        wrap.throw(SpamException)
    else:
        wrap.send(i)

# Expected Result
>>  0
>>  1
>>  2
***
>>  4

# Actual Result
>>  0
>>  1
>>  2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ... redacted ...
  File ... in writer_wrapper
    x = (yield)
__main__.SpamException
```
Um, it's not working because x = (yield) just raises the exception and everything comes to a crashing halt. Let's make it work, but manually handling exceptions and sending them or throwing them into the sub-generator (writer)

```python
def writer_wrapper(coro):
    """Works. Manually catches exceptions and throws them"""
    coro.send(None)  # prime the coro
    while True:
        try:
            try:
                x = (yield)
            except Exception as e:   # This catches the SpamException
                coro.throw(e)
            else:
                coro.send(x)
        except StopIteration:
            pass

# Result
>>  0
>>  1
>>  2
***
>>  4
```
👉 But so does this!

```python
def writer_wrapper(coro):
    yield from coro
```

### ✔Yield From With Close
👉 Without using yield from if we execute close() on the outer generator the inner generator will be left suspended.

```python
import inspect

var = None


def nested_generator():
    for _ in range(5):
        k = yield
        print("inner generator received = " + str(k))


def outer_generator():
    global var
    nested_gen = nested_generator()
    var = nested_gen
    next(nested_gen)

    for _ in range(5):
        k = yield
        try:
            nested_gen.send(k)
        except StopIteration:
            pass


if __name__ == "__main__":

    gen = outer_generator()
    next(gen)

    try:
        gen.close()
        print("Outer generator state: " + inspect.getgeneratorstate(gen))
        print("Inner generator state: " + inspect.getgeneratorstate(var))

    except StopIteration:
        pass
        
 OutPut:
Outer generator state: GEN_CLOSED
Inner generator state: GEN_SUSPENDED
```

👉 Solution to the above:
```python
import inspect

var = None


def nested_generator():
    for _ in range(5):
        k = yield
        print("inner generator received = " + str(k))


def outer_generator():
    global var
    nested_gen = nested_generator()
    var = nested_gen
    yield from nested_gen


if __name__ == "__main__":

    gen = outer_generator()
    next(gen)

    try:
        gen.close()
        print("Outer generator state: " + inspect.getgeneratorstate(gen))
        print("Inner generator state: " + inspect.getgeneratorstate(var))

    except StopIteration:
        pass
```

### ✔Deep flattens a nested list
```python
Examples:
    >>> list(flatten_list([1, 2, [3, 4], [5, 6, [7]]]))
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    >>> list(flatten_list(['apple', 'banana', ['orange', 'lemon']]))
    ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'lemon']
"""


def flatten_list(L):
    for item in L:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            yield from flatten_list(item)
        else:
            yield item
```


### ✔Most important points are:

👉 What yield from does is it establishes a transparent bidirectional connection between the caller and the sub-generator:

👉 The connection is "transparent" in the sense that it will propagate everything correctly too, not just the elements being generated (e.g. exceptions are propagated).

👉 The connection is "bidirectional" in the sense that data can be both sent from and to a generator.
