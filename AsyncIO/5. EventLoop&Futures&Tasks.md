### Futures
- Future represents a computation that is either in progress or will get scheduled in the future. 
- It is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.
- ðŸ‘‰ Don't confuse threading.Future and asyncio.Future. The former is part of the threading module and doesn't have an __iter__() method defined on it. asyncio.Future is an awaitable and can be used with the yield from statement
- **In general you shouldn't need to deal with futures directly.**
- 

### Tasks

Tasks are like futures in fact Task is a subclass of Future. Tasks can be created using the following methods:

    âœ” asyncio.create_task() introduced in Python 3.7 and preferred way of creating tasks. The method accepts coroutines and wraps them as tasks.

    âœ” loop.create_task() only accepts coroutines.

    âœ” asyncio.ensure_future() accepts Futures, coroutines and any awaitable objects.

- Tasks wrap coroutines and run them in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the Future to complete. 
- When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes. Event loops use cooperative scheduling, the event loop runs one Task at a time. 
- While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations. Tasks can also be cancelled.

```python
import asyncio
from asyncio import Future


async def bar(future):
    print("bar will sleep for 3 seconds")
    await asyncio.sleep(3)
    print("bar resolving the future")
    future.done()
    future.set_result("future is resolved")


async def foo(future):
    print("foo will await the future")
    await future
    print("foo finds the future resolved")


async def main():
    future = Future()

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    t1 = loop.create_task(bar(future))
    t2 = loop.create_task(foo(future))

    await t2, t1


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
    print("main exiting")
```
### Event Loop
- On any platform, when we want to do something asynchronously, it usually involves an event loop
- *An event loop is a loop that can register tasks to be executed, execute them,delay or even cancel them and handle different events related to these operations. Generally, we   schedule multiple async functions to the event loop. The loop runs one    
  function, while that function waits for IO, it pauses it and runs another. When the first function completes IO, it is resumed. Thus two or more functions can co-operatively  
  run together. This the main goal of an event loop.*
- The event loop is a programming construct that waits for events to happen and then dispatches them to an event handler.
- One of the most common use cases you'll find in the wild is of webservers implemented using asynchronous design. A webserver waits for an HTTP request to arrive and returns the matching resource.
- Snippet to run an Event loop:

```python
import asyncio
import time


async def do_something_important():
    await asyncio.sleep(10)


if __name__ == "__main__":

  start = time.time()

  # Python 3.7+ syntax
  # asyncio.run(do_something_important())

  # Python 3.5 syntax
  loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
  loop.run_until_complete(do_something_important())

  print("Program ran for {0} seconds".format(time.time() - start))
  ```
  ### Running Multiple Event loops
  
 ```python
import asyncio, random
from threading import Thread
from threading import current_thread


async def do_something_important(sleep_for):
    print("Is event loop running in thread {0} = {1}\n".format(current_thread().getName(),
                                                         asyncio.get_event_loop().is_running()))

    await asyncio.sleep(sleep_for)


def launch_event_loops():
    # get a new event loop
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()

    # set the event loop for the current thread
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)

    # run a coroutine on the event loop
    loop.run_until_complete(do_something_important(random.randint(1, 5)))

    # remember to close the loop
    loop.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    t1 = Thread(target=launch_event_loops)
    t2 = Thread(target=launch_event_loops)

    t1.start()
    t2.start()

    print("Is event loop running in thread {0} = {1}\n".format(current_thread().getName(),
                                                         asyncio.get_event_loop().is_running()))

    t1.join()
    t2.join()
  ```
### Invoking Callbacks
- The event loop can be used to schedule regular functions to be executed as well. The asyncio loop has two APIs: asyncio.call_soon() and asyncio.call_later() for this purpose.
- In the example in the code widget below, we schedule a coroutine to run on the event loop. The coroutine creates a future and awaits it until the future is resolved by a callback.

```python
import asyncio, random, time
from threading import Thread
from threading import current_thread
from asyncio import Future

def resolver(future):
    print("Is loop running in thread {0} = {1}\n".format(current_thread().getName(),
                                                         asyncio.get_event_loop().is_running()))

    time.sleep(2)
    future.set_result(None)


async def coro():
    future = Future()

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.call_later(5, resolver, future)

    print("Is loop running in thread {0} = {1}\n".format(current_thread().getName(),
                                                         asyncio.get_event_loop().is_running()))


    await future
    print("coro exiting")


if __name__ == "__main__":

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    print("Is loop running in thread {0} = {1}\n".format(current_thread().getName(),
                                                         asyncio.get_event_loop().is_running()))

    loop.run_until_complete(coro())
    print("main exiting")
```
### Types of Event Loops

There are two types of event loops:

1. SelectorEventLoop 
2. ProactorEventLoop

- The **SelectorEventLoop** is based on the selectors module and is the default loop on all platforms. 
- The selectors module contains the poll() and the select() APIs that form the secret sauce behind the event loop. 
- **ProactorEventLoop**, on the other hand, uses Windows' I/O Completion Ports and is only supported on Windows.
