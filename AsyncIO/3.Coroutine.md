# What is a coroutine?
- A coroutine can be defined as a special function that can give up control to its caller without losing its state.

### Difference with Generators
The distinction between generators and coroutines, in general, is that:

âœ” Generators yield back a value to the invoker whereas a coroutine yields control to another coroutine and can resume execution from the point it gives up control.

âœ” A generator can't accept arguments once started whereas a coroutine can.

âœ” Generators are primarily used to simplify writing iterators. They are a type of coroutine and sometimes also called as semicoroutines.

### Difference with threads
One of the major benefits of coroutines over threads is that coroutines donâ€™t use as much memory as threads do.

ðŸ‘‰ Coroutines don't require operating system support or invoke system calls.

ðŸ‘‰ Coroutines don't need to worry about synchronizing access to shared data-structures or guarding critical sections. Mutexes, semaphore and other synchronization constructs aren't required.

ðŸ‘‰ **Coroutines are concurrent but not parallel.**

### Types of Coroutines 
there are two ways to define coroutines in Python: an older generator based mechanism and the newer shiny async def syntax. The two types of Python coroutines are:

âœ” Generator based coroutines

âœ” Native coroutines
