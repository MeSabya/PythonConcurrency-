# Semaphores
A semaphore is nothing more than an atomic counter that gets decremented by one whenever acquire() is invoked and incremented by one whenever release() is called. The semaphore can be initialized with an initial count value. If none is specified, the semaphore is initialized with a value of one.

## Creating a Semaphore

            semaphore initialized with a default count of 1

            semaphore = Semaphore()

            semaphore initialized with count set to 5

            sem_with_count = Semaphore(5)
            
### acquire()
If a thread invokes acquire() on a semaphore, the semaphore counter is decremented by one. If the count is greater than 0, then the thread immediately returns from the acquire() call. If the semaphore counter is zero when a thread invokes acquire(), the thread gets blocked till another thread releases the semaphore.

### release ( )
When a thread invokes the release() method, the internal semaphore counter is incremented by one. If the counter value is zero and another thread is already blocked on an acquire() then a release would unblock the waiting thread. If multiple threads are blocked on the semaphore, then one thread is arbitrarily chosen.


## Using Semaphores

The primary use of semaphores is signaling among threads which are working to achieve a common goal. Consider the below snippet which uses a condition variable between threads.

#### Missed Signal

```python
from threading import Thread
from threading import Condition
import time


def task1():
    cond_var.acquire()
    cond_var.wait()
    cond_var.release()


def task2():
    cond_var.acquire()
    cond_var.notify()
    cond_var.release()


cond_var = Condition()

# start thread 2 first which invokes notify
thread2 = Thread(target=task2)
thread2.start()

# delay starting thread 1 by three seconds
time.sleep(3)

# start thread 1
thread1 = Thread(target=task1)
thread1.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()
```

ðŸ‘† One way to remedy the above situation is to use semaphores. The internal counter of the semaphore remembers how many times the signal was received. Replacing the above code with semaphore looks as follows:

```python
from threading import Thread
from threading import Semaphore
import time


def task1():
    sem.acquire()


def task2():
    sem.release()

# initialize with zero
sem = Semaphore(0)

# start thread 2 first which invokes release()
thread2 = Thread(target=task2)
thread2.start()

# delay starting thread 1 by three seconds
time.sleep(3)

# start thread 1
thread1 = Thread(target=task1)
thread1.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()
```
