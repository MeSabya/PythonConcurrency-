# Lock
- Python's Lock is the equivalent of a Mutex and this lesson looks at its various uses.
- It offers two methods: acquire() and release().

## Why do we need locks for threads, if we have GIL?
For example, if you have this code:

       self.some_number += 1

That is going to read value of self.some_number, calculate some_number+1 and then write it back to self.some_number.

If you do that in two threads, the operations (read, add, write) of one thread and the other may be mixed, so that the result is wrong.

This could be the order of execution:

- thread1 reads self.some_number (0)
- thread2 reads self.some_number (0)
- thread1 calculates some_number+1 (1)
- thread2 calculates some_number+1 (1)
- thread1 writes 1 to self.some_number
- thread2 writes 1 to self.some_number

You use locks to enforce this order of execution:

- thread1 reads self.some_number (0)
- thread1 calculates some_number+1 (1)
- thread1 writes 1 to self.some_number
- thread2 reads self.some_number (1)
- thread2 calculates some_number+1 (2)
- thread2 writes 2 to self.some_number

## Acquire
If a Lock object is already acquired/locked and a thread attempts to acquire() it, the thread will be blocked till the Lock object is released. If the caller doesn't want to be blocked indefinitely, a floating point timeout value can be passed in to the acquire() method. The method returns true if the lock is successfully acquired and false if not.

## Release
The release() method will change the state of the Lock object to unlocked and give a chance to other waiting threads to acquire the lock. If multiple threads are already blocked on the acquire call then only one arbitrarily chosen (varies across implementations) thread is allowed to acquire the Lock object and proceed.

```python
from threading import Lock
from threading import Thread , current_thread
import time


shared_state = [1, 2, 3]
my_lock = Lock()

def thread1_operations():
    my_lock.acquire()
    print("thread1 operatiosn {0} has acquired the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
    
    time.sleep(3)
    shared_state[0] = 777
    
    print("thread1 operatiosn {0} about to release the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
    my_lock.release()
    print("thread1 operatiosn {0} released the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
    
def thread2_operations():
    print("thread2 operatiosn {0} is attempting to acquire the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
    my_lock.acquire()
    print("thread2 operatiosn {0} has acquired the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))

    print(shared_state[0])
    print("thread2 operatiosn {0} about to release the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
    my_lock.release()
    print("thread2 operatiosn {0} released the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    thread1 = Thread(target=thread1_operations, name="thread1")
    thread1.start()
    
    thread2 = Thread(target=thread2_operations, name="thread2")
    thread2.start()
    
    thread1.join()
    thread2.join()
```
