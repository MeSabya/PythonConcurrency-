# RLock

*A reentrant lock is defined as a lock which can be reacquired by the same thread. A RLock object carries the notion of ownership. If a thread acquires a RLock object, it can chose to reacquire it as many times as possible. Consider the following snippet:*

```python
# create a reentrant lock
rlock = RLock()

# acquire the lock twice
rlock.acquire()
rlock.acquire()

# release the lock twice
rlock.release()
rlock.release()
```

*In contrast to Lock, the reentrant lock is acquired twice in the above snippet without blocking. Note that it is imperative to release the lock as many times as it is locked, otherwise the lock remains in locked state and any other threads attempting to acquire the lock get blocked.*

## Owership
As explained, each reentrant lock is owned by some thread when in the locked state. Only the owner thread is allowed to exercise a release() on the lock. If a thread different than the owner invokes release() a RuntimeError is thrown as shown in the example below:

```python
from threading import RLock
from threading import Thread


def perform_unlock():
    rlock.release()
    print("child task executing")
    rlock.release()


rlock = RLock()

# reentrant lock acquired by main thread
rlock.acquire()

# let's attempt to unlock using a child thread
thread = Thread(target=perform_unlock)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

                Exception in thread Thread-1:
                Traceback (most recent call last):
