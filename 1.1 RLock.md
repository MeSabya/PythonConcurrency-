# RLock

*A reentrant lock is defined as a lock which can be reacquired by the same thread. A RLock object carries the notion of ownership. If a thread acquires a RLock object, it can chose to reacquire it as many times as possible. Consider the following snippet:*

```python
# create a reentrant lock
rlock = RLock()

# acquire the lock twice
rlock.acquire()
rlock.acquire()

# release the lock twice
rlock.release()
rlock.release()
```

*In contrast to Lock, the reentrant lock is acquired twice in the above snippet without blocking. Note that it is imperative to release the lock as many times as it is locked, otherwise the lock remains in locked state and any other threads attempting to acquire the lock get blocked.*
