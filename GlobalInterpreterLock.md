# What is Global Interpreter lock ? 
## How Python works
- Python is an interpreted language, that is, there is no static time compiling as that happens in the case of Java, C or C++. 
- **At a higher level when we run a Python program (.py file), the Python interpreter compiles the source code into byte code.**
- The generated byte code is a lower-level platform-independent representation that can be understood by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). 
- The byte code is routed to the PVM for execution. Note that PVM isn't a separate component. 
- Rather, it is just a loop in the Python interpreter that is responsible for executing byte code line by line. The PVM is really a part of the interpreter.

### The Python interpreter can only execute a single thread at a time. 
>So if your machine has one, ten, or a hundred processors, the Python interpreter is only able to run a single thread at a time using a single processor. 
Two threads on a machine with two available processors can't be executed in parallel each running on a single CPU.
This design has direct consequences on the performance of CPU bound programs. 

## Why is that so?
>The answer lies in how memory management works in Python - reference counter.

When references to an object are removed, the reference count for an object is decremented. When the reference count becomes zero, the object is deallocated. 
The interpreter executes a single thread in order to ensure that the reference count for objects is safe from race conditions.

ðŸ‘‰A reference count is associated with each object in a program. One possible solution could have been to associate one lock per object so that multiple threads 
could work on the object in a thread-safe manner. However, this approach would have resulted in too many locks being managed with the possibility of deadlocks. 
Thus, a compromise was made to have a single lock that provides exclusive access to the Python interpreter. This lock is known as the **Global Interpreter Lock**.

## Removing GIL
One may wonder why the GIL can't be removed from Python because of the limitations it imposes on CPU-bound programs. 
Attempts at removing GIL resulted in breaking C extensions and degrading the performance of single and multithreaded I/O bound programs. 
Therefore, so far GIL hasn't been removed from Python.
